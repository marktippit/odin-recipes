        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 cup unsalted butter, softened </li>
            <li> 1 cup brown sugar </li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pecan oil, optional </li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder </li>
            <li>â…› teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>1 cup finely chopped pecans </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
           <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
           <li>Combine butter, brown sugar, and sugar in a bowl and cream with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract and pecan oil and beat until well combined.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Add the flour mixture to the bowl in 3 additions. Stir in pecans. Use a small cookie scoop to drop portions of dough 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. These cookies spread.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Increase heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until edges turn golden, about 5 minutes more. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
